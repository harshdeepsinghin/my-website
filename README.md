# my-website

Personal website built with Hugo. This repository contains the source for a Hugo site (content, theme, and static assets) and the generated `public/` site output.

**Quick Summary**
- **Tech:** Hugo (static site generator)
- **Theme:** custom theme in `themes/shellterm`
- **Content:** Markdown files in `content/` (posts, pages, etc.)
- **Output:** Generated site lives in `public/` after running `hugo`

**Prerequisites**
- Install Hugo (macOS/Homebrew):

```
brew install hugo
```

- Optional: use a package manager or platform for deployment (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

**Local development**
- Serve the site locally with drafts enabled:

```
hugo server -D
```

This starts a local server (default `http://localhost:1313`) and watches for file changes.

If you need a command tuned for the fish shell (default shell on this machine), the same command works as-is.

**Build (production)**
- Generate the static site into `public/`:

```
hugo
```

The generated files will be in `public/` and can be deployed to any static-hosting provider.

**Deploy**
- Common options:
  - GitHub Pages: push the contents of `public/` to `gh-pages` branch (or use an action to build and publish).
  - Netlify/Vercel: connect the repo and set the build command to `hugo` and publish directory to `public`.

There is a `CNAME` file present if you use a custom domain.

**Repository structure (important paths)**
- `content/` — site content (posts, pages). Add new posts under `content/posts/` as Markdown files.
- `themes/shellterm/` — theme files and templates.
- `static/` (if present inside a theme or site root) — static assets accessible at site root.
- `public/` — generated site (do not edit directly; this is output from `hugo`).

**Adding a new post**
- Create a new Markdown file under `content/posts/`, e.g. `content/posts/my-new-post.md`.
- Include front matter at the top (YAML/TOML) with `title`, `date`, `tags`, etc.

**Notes & suggestions**
- This repo already contains a `themes/shellterm` theme and several posts inside `content/posts/`.
- Consider adding a small CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to build and deploy on push.

**Contributing**
- Open an issue or a pull request. Keep content in `content/` and layout changes in `themes/shellterm/`.

**License**
- If you want this repo to have a license, add a `LICENSE` file at the repo root.

If you want, I can also:
- Add a simple GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy the site.
- Add basic contributor guidelines or a template for new posts.
