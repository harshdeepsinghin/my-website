Designed for students, learners, and creators who want to get the most out of AI assistance.\nSyllabus to Tasks I will provide you with a syllabus. Your task is to break it down into a set of Markdown tasks, structured as follows: Use unit titles as headings (##) with lecture hours mentioned in parentheses. Break down each unit into detailed subtasks (- [ ]), including subtopics or concepts. For topics with further subdivisions, use indented subtasks (- [ ] followed by - [ ] or - [ ] for further nesting). Group related topics under appropriate sections like Process Management or Thread Management, ensuring logical organisation. Here‚Äôs an example format: markdown Copy code ## Unit I: [Unit Name] ([Lecture Hours] Lecture Hours) - [ ] [Main Topic] - [ ] [Another Main Topic] - [ ] [Subtopic 1] - [ ] [Subtopic 2] - [ ] [Subtopic 3] - [ ] [Next Main Topic] - [ ] [Subtopic] - [ ] [Further Subdivision] - [ ] [Additional Topics] ## Unit II: [Next Unit Name] ([Lecture Hours] Lecture Hours) ### [Subsection Title] - [ ] [Main Topic] - [ ] [Another Main Topic] - [ ] [Subtopic 1] - [ ] [Subtopic 2] - [ ] [Further Detail] ### Case Study - [ ] [Specific Case Study Topic] Please ensure all details from the syllabus are included in the breakdown, and structure the tasks as actionable learning objectives or key topics to review. Syllabus Skimming Act as a \u0026lt;SUBJECT\u0026gt; expert and guide me through my syllabus by providing an overview or idea of each topic. Start with the first topic and give a brief idea about it. Don‚Äôt give details about all topics at once‚Äîkeep going only when I say \u0026#39;next.\u0026#39; I want to get an idea of each topic before diving into deep study, so I can skim through the subject. If I say \u0026#39;more,\u0026#39; elaborate on the topic in detail. With every topic, give the associated keywords. \u0026lt;SYLLABUS\u0026gt; Depth Subject Study Act as a \u0026lt;SUBJECT\u0026gt; expert in and guide me through the following syllabus, one item at a time. Each item‚Äîwhether a main topic or a subtopic‚Äîshould be treated as an **individual, deeply detailed thread**. For each topic or subtopic, provide: - A thorough explanation of all related concepts, theories, and mechanisms - Practical applications and real-world examples to enhance understanding - Definitions and explanations of all important terms - Related prerequisite knowledge, and if covered earlier, refer back to it - References to previously discussed material where relevant - Socratic-style questions to test my understanding and provoke critical thinking - A smooth structure starting from basics to advanced insights where applicable ### ‚úÖ **Optional Example Usage:** If the syllabus is: - [ ] Introduction to Software Reliability - [ ] Hardware vs. Software Reliability - [ ] Reliability Metrics - [ ] Failure and Faults - [ ] Prevention - [ ] Removal - [ ] Tolerance - [ ] Forecasting Then ChatGPT should respond like this: \u0026gt; ‚úÖ **Introduction to Software Reliability** \u0026gt; _[Full-depth explanation with examples, keyword definitions, and critical thinking questions]_ \u0026gt; _(Waits for ‚Äúnext‚Äù or ‚Äúmore‚Äù)_ Then: \u0026gt; ‚úÖ **Hardware vs. Software Reliability** \u0026gt; _[Explanation, plus reference back to ‚ÄúIntroduction to Software Reliability‚Äù if needed]_ \u0026gt; _(Waits for ‚Äúnext‚Äù or ‚Äúmore‚Äù)_ And so on. ‚è≥ Only proceed to the **next item** when I say **\u0026#34;next.\u0026#34;** üîÅ If I say **\u0026#34;more,\u0026#34;** expand on the current topic with **deeper details, advanced knowledge, or extra examples.** üîó If a topic depends on prior topics, point that out and briefly recap or link back to them. Do **not** skip any item, regardless of whether it‚Äôs a main topic or a subtopic. Here is the syllabus: \u0026lt;SYLLABUS\u0026gt; Random Topic Revision Given a list of topics in my syllabus, pick a random topic for me to review. Each time I say \u0026#39;next,\u0026#39; provide a different topic from the list, one by one, in a random order, until all topics are covered, then start again in a spaced repetition cycle. If I say \u0026#39;help,\u0026#39; give me small hints to help me recall the topic without actually describing it directly. \u0026lt;SYLLABUS\u0026gt; Technical Documentation Writer Act as a professional technical documentation writer and help me in writing documentation for my project i will keep providing you my codes and readmes u just wait until i say you to give me the documentation PYQs Insights I will provide multiple Previous Year Questions (PYQs) text one by one. You will extract, store, and organize the topics, subtopics, and question frequency but **wait for my explicit instruction** to analyze or summarize the data. At the end, I will upload the text of my current syllabus. Based on the syllabus and the stored PYQ data: 1. **Identify topics** that appear in the syllabus and match them with PYQ coverage. 2. **Provide insights**, such as: - The number of times each topic has appeared in PYQs. - Weightage distribution across topics. - Trends in question frequency. 3. **Analyze topic interrelations**, identifying questions or concepts that combine multiple topics or subtopics to help me study them holistically. Finally, help me focus on important topics to maximize marks with this smart practice. DeepSeek Text Concatenation I will provide you with multiple ChatGPT conversation texts. Your task is to combine all the content into one single file without modifying, editing, or altering any of the original text. Simply concatenate all the provided conversations in the exact order they are given, preserving all formatting, spacing, and punctuation. Do not add any headers, footers, or separators between the conversations‚Äîjust append each new text directly to the end of the previous one. Confirm when ready for the first input. This ensures: 1. **No data changes** (original text preserved exactly) 2. **Simple concatenation** (no added separators or metadata) 3. **Clear instructions** for batch processing (mention \u0026#34;single file\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;big text\u0026#34;) ","date":"2024-10-09T12:59:00Z","permalink":"https://harshdeepsingh.in/posts/ai-prompts/"},{"title":"Note Taking Guide","content":"In this guide, I‚Äôve shared three simple yet powerful note-taking techniques I learned from Nick Milo: Freelining, Freetalking, and Freewriting. These methods have helped me brain-dump thoughts quickly with less friction, making it easier to think clearly and capture ideas in real time. Whether I\u0026rsquo;m typing in Obsidian or jotting things on paper, these techniques let me get my thoughts out without judgment, structure, or overthinking‚Äîand that‚Äôs the whole point.\nIntroduction Note taking starts with dumping your first ideas on paper. The first spark of thought should be dumped on paper as soon as the thought resonates you. There should be as less friction as possible while writing down your thoughts. It could be paper, or any digital application as I am using [[3. Resources/Obsidian]]. Never forget to mention dates. The credit for these techniques goes to Nick Milo, a YouTuber who teaches about linking your thoughts, productivity, note taking and more. This YouTube video taught me these techniques. These are the 3 techniques: Freelining Freetalking Freewriting Freelining It basically says that, write down your thoughts without any formatting, without worrying about being judged by yourself for the way of noting. Instead, just noting what comes to mind. Freeline in bullet points. Every new thought should be in a new bullet. Few prompts for Freelining: That is interesting because\u0026hellip; That is important because\u0026hellip; That resonates me because\u0026hellip; That reminds me of\u0026hellip; Freetalking This states that we note down our thoughts just as we talk to somebody or ourselves as we are talking to the device. Freetalk in blocks Just start your dictation mode and start telling about your thoughts or view on the topic you are noting. It\u0026rsquo;s as simple as that. Remember not to flow for minutes without breaking down the points in chunks. Keep pressing return/enter key while speaking, so that you don\u0026rsquo;t end up with a junk of thoughts. Breaking into chunks will help you analysing your points. However, every chunk should have it\u0026rsquo;s own related meaning. Then only you should break your thought. Freewriting It is basically writing your thoughts without any censoring, pausing or formatting. Just flow and write whatever comes to your mind. There are few rules for freewriting: Don\u0026rsquo;t edit Don\u0026rsquo;t stop Don\u0026rsquo;t censor or filter Keep writing ","date":"2024-09-30T17:07:00Z","permalink":"https://harshdeepsingh.in/posts/note-taking-guide/"},{"title":"My Cryptography Learning Journey","content":"This post documents my personal journey of learning cryptography, especially focusing on RSA and Diffie-Hellman.
