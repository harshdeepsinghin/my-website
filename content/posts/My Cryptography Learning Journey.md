This post documents my personal journey of learning cryptography. I’ve curated and organized the exact resources, videos, and concepts I used—starting from foundational math to public key cryptography. If you're someone starting out or struggling with the core ideas, this learning path might give you the clarity and structure you need.

## 1. Cryptography Fundamentals

First, I built my foundation with these resources:
- [Cybrary Cryptography Course](https://pastebin.com/druLLMUz) Use this text to copy and paste into any AI of your choice, then you can read the summarised version generated by the AI just to kickstart.

## 2. Cryptography Basics

These videos helped me understand core concepts:
- Crypto Basics Part 1

- Crypto Basics Part 2  
  {{< youtube Xb4_VT4y9kQ >}}

- For Cryptography Mathematics (including Modular Arithmetic, Prime Numbers, GCD, Euler's Totient Functions or Theorems, Fermat's Theorems, Groups, Fields and etc.) Just go and [Watch Cryptography Mathematics Playlist →](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjjeHdm0cwu6E-nhhEluuVA)

## 3.0 RSA Prerequisites (Math Fundamentals)

### Modular Exponentiation
When an exponent is very large, you **cannot calculate (a^b) directly**, so you apply modular arithmetic shortcuts. The method you choose depends on the type of modulus and numbers involved.

1. If nothing special → use **Fast Modular Exponentiation**.
2. If modulus is prime → **use Fermat’s Little Theorem** to reduce exponent.
3. If modulus non-prime but gcd(a, m) = 1 → **use Euler’s Totient** to reduce exponent.
4. If modulus is composite and factorable → **use CRT** to break and recombine.
5. If exponent is a power tower → **reduce exponent first**, then compute using fast mod exponentiation.
