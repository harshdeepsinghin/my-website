## ‚≠êÔ∏è Context
This note is about 3 fun and easy techniques of brain-dumping your thoughts as soon as they strikes your mind.

## üìù Content
### Introduction
- Note taking starts with dumping your first ideas on paper.
- The first spark of thought should be dumped on paper as soon as the thought resonates you.
- There should be as less friction as possible while writing down your thoughts.
- It could be paper, or any digital application as I am using [[3. Resources/Obsidian]].
- Never forget to mention **dates**.
- The credit for these techniques goes to Nick Milo, a YouTuber who teaches about linking your thoughts, productivity, note taking and more. [This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQkMTHKl1D8) taught me these techniques.
- These are the 3 techniques:
	- [Freelining](#freelining)
	- [Freetalking](#freetalking)
	- [Freewriting](#freewriting)

#### Freelining
- It basically says that, write down your thoughts without any formatting, without worrying about being judged by yourself for the way of noting. Instead, just noting what comes to mind.
- Freeline in bullet points.
- Every new thought should be in a new bullet.
- Few prompts for Freelining: 
	- That is interesting because...
	- That is important because...
	- That resonates me because...
	- That reminds me of...
	- 
#### Freetalking
- This states that we note down our thoughts just as we talk to somebody or ourselves as we are talking to the device.
- Freetalk in blocks
- Just start your dictation mode and start telling about your thoughts or view on the topic you are noting. It's as simple as that.
- Remember not to flow for minutes without breaking down the points in chunks.
- Keep pressing return/enter key while speaking, so that you don't end up with a junk of thoughts.
- Breaking into chunks will help you analysing your points. However, every chunk should have it's own related meaning. Then only you should break your thought.

#### Freewriting
- It is basically writing your thoughts without any censoring, pausing or formatting.
- Just flow and write whatever comes to your mind.
- There are few rules for freewriting:
	- Don't edit
	- Don't stop
	- Don't censor or filter
	- Keep writing
