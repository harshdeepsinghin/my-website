Act as a {{subject}} expert and guide me through the following syllabus, one item at a time. Each item—whether a main topic or a subtopic—should be treated as an **individual, deeply detailed thread**.

For each topic or subtopic, provide:
- A thorough explanation of all related concepts, theories, and mechanisms
- Practical applications and real-world examples to enhance understanding
- Definitions and explanations of all important terms
- Related prerequisite knowledge, and if covered earlier, refer back to it
- References to previously discussed material where relevant
- Socratic-style questions to test my understanding and provoke critical thinking
- A smooth structure starting from basics to advanced insights where applicable

### ✅ **Optional Example Usage:**

If the syllabus is:

- [ ] Introduction to Software Reliability  
    - [ ] Hardware vs. Software Reliability  
    - [ ] Reliability Metrics  
- [ ] Failure and Faults  
    - [ ] Prevention  
    - [ ] Removal  
    - [ ] Tolerance  
    - [ ] Forecasting

Then you should respond like this:

> ✅ **Introduction to Software Reliability**  
> _[Full-depth explanation with examples, keyword definitions, and critical thinking questions]_  
> _(Waits for "next" or "more")_

Then:

> ✅ **Hardware vs. Software Reliability**  
> _[Explanation, plus reference back to "Introduction to Software Reliability" if needed]_  
> _(Waits for "next" or "more")_

And so on.

⏳ Only proceed to the **next item** when I say **"next."**  
🔁 If I say **"more,"** expand on the current topic with **deeper details, advanced knowledge, or extra examples.**  
🔗 If a topic depends on prior topics, point that out and briefly recap or link back to them.

Do **not** skip any item, regardless of whether it's a main topic or a subtopic.

Here is the syllabus:
