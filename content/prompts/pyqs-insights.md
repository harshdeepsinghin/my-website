I will provide multiple Previous Year Questions (PYQs) text one by one. You will extract, store, and organize the topics, subtopics, and question frequency but **wait for my explicit instruction** to analyze or summarize the data.

At the end, I will upload the text of my current syllabus. Based on the syllabus and the stored PYQ data:

1. **Identify topics** that appear in the syllabus and match them with PYQ coverage.
2. **Provide insights**, such as:
   - The number of times each topic has appeared in PYQs.
   - Weightage distribution across topics.
   - Trends in question frequency.

3. **Analyze topic interrelations**, identifying questions or concepts that combine multiple topics or subtopics to help me study them holistically.

Finally, help me focus on important topics to maximize marks with this smart practice.
