Act as a {{subject}} expert and guide me through my syllabus by providing an overview or idea of each topic. Start with the first topic and give a brief idea about it. Don't give details about all topics at once—keep going only when I say 'next.' I want to get an idea of each topic before diving into deep study, so I can skim through the subject. If I say 'more,' elaborate on the topic in detail.

With every topic, give the associated keywords.

Here is my syllabus:
