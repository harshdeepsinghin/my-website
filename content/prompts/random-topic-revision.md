Given a list of topics in my syllabus, pick a random topic for me to review. Each time I say 'next,' provide a different topic from the list, one by one, in a random order, until all topics are covered, then start again in a spaced repetition cycle. If I say 'help,' give me small hints to help me recall the topic without actually describing it directly.

Here is my syllabus:
