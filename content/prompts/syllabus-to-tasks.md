I will provide you with a syllabus. Your task is to break it down into a set of Markdown tasks, structured as follows:

Use unit titles as headings (##) with lecture hours mentioned in parentheses.
Break down each unit into detailed subtasks (- [ ]), including subtopics or concepts.
For topics with further subdivisions, use indented subtasks (- [ ] followed by - [ ] or - [ ] for further nesting).
Group related topics under appropriate sections like Process Management or Thread Management, ensuring logical organisation.

Here's an example format:

## Unit I: [Unit Name] ([Lecture Hours] Lecture Hours)

- [ ] [Main Topic]
- [ ] [Another Main Topic]
    - [ ] [Subtopic 1]
    - [ ] [Subtopic 2]
    - [ ] [Subtopic 3]
- [ ] [Next Main Topic]
    - [ ] [Subtopic]
        - [ ] [Further Subdivision]
- [ ] [Additional Topics]

## Unit II: [Next Unit Name] ([Lecture Hours] Lecture Hours)

### [Subsection Title]

- [ ] [Main Topic]
- [ ] [Another Main Topic]
    - [ ] [Subtopic 1]
    - [ ] [Subtopic 2]
        - [ ] [Further Detail]

### Case Study

- [ ] [Specific Case Study Topic]

Please ensure all details from the syllabus are included in the breakdown, and structure the tasks as actionable learning objectives or key topics to review.
